Loop Code:

while (low_bound <= high_bound){
            int middle = (low_bound + high_bound) /2;
            if(search == arr[middle])
                return middle;
            else if (search < arr[middle]){
                high_bound = middle -1;
            }
            else{
                low_bound = middle + 1;
            }
}

// Thoughts //
the while loop will run as a bgt, the moment lower > upper branch to not found
Setting middle with addition of left and right then shifting right
first beq value of search == value of arr[middle]
