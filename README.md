C Algos translated into RISC Algos

Initially covering these algorithms

1. Linear Search: Search for an element in an array by checking each one sequentially.

2. Bubble Sort: Sort an array by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they’re in the wrong order.

3. Binary Search: Efficiently search a sorted array by dividing it in half each time.

4. Selection Sort: Find the minimum element in an unsorted part and swap it with the first unsorted position.

5. Insertion Sort: Build a sorted array by inserting each new element into its correct position.

6. Recursion (e.g., Factorial, Fibonacci): Solve problems by breaking them into smaller subproblems, like calculating factorials.

7. Matrix Multiplication: Multiply two matrices using nested loops.

8. String Manipulation (e.g., Reverse a String, Check Palindrome): Perform basic operations on strings, like reversing or checking if they’re palindromes.

The algos directory contains directories for each algorithm, each algo folder contains both the C an Assm code.
